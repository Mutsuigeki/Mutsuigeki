My name is Finn or Zenthic. However you can call me anything you'd like.

I'm very interested in the Touhou Project and Len'en Project franchise. Interests: Project Moon, Indie Games, Visual Novels, When They Cry, TYPE-MOON, Blue Archive, Hylics, Rain World, VVVVVV, Tower of Heaven, Binding of Isaac, Hyperdimension Neptunia, Umamusume, Geometry Dash, 100% Orange Juice, Anime, otaku culture in general.

My music taste is trash don't expect me to give you 'good' recommendations. I love all things chiptune <3

Sometimes I can't read the room because I'm autistic, but I'm trying my best to pick up sarcastic tones. I barely have any friends so it's difficult for me to communicate with others since I could get very lost or talk about meaningless stuff. I'm very bad at communication.

These are my friends:
