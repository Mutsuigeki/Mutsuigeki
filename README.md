My name is Finn or Zenthic, however you can call me anything you'd like. Even "poo."

I'm very interested in the Touhou Project and Len'en Project franchise. The following interests I like: Project Moon, indie games, visual novels, When They Cry, TYPE-MOON, Blue Archive, Hyperdimension Neptunia, Umamusume, Geometry Dash, 100% Orange Juice, and Anime.

My music taste is trash don't expect me to give you 'good' recommendations. I really like chiptune.

I'm autistic, sometimes I can't read the room, but I'm trying my best to pick up sarcastic tones. I barely have any friends so it's difficult for me to communicate with others since I could get very lost or talk about meaningless stuff. I'm very bad at communication, sorry.

These are my friends:
